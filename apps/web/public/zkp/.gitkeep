# This directory will contain the compiled circuit files:
# - vote.wasm (WASM circuit for browser proving)
# - vote_final.zkey (proving key)
#
# These files are generated by running:
#   cd circuits && ./scripts/compile.sh && ./scripts/setup.sh
#
# Then copy the files from circuits/build/ to this directory.
